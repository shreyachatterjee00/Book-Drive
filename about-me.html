<p> Hi! My name is Shreya, and I independently organized and led a book drive for a tutoring non-profit. I'm currently a senior at Notre Dame High School, and enjoy reading, debating during Mock Trial, and coding. In fact, I coded this website myself!</p>

 <!--   <p> <strong> Book Series: </strong> Harry Potter: who doesn't want to live in a magical world? </p> </br>
        <p><strong> Movie: </strong> Dirty Dancing: a fiercely feminist film with a superb soundtrack. </p> </br>
        <p> <strong> Ice Cream: </strong> Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough </p> </br>
        <p> <strong> Food: </strong> Bagel: seriously, I love bagels. I'm happy to eat them for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. </p> </br>
        <p> <strong> Place to be: </strong> At home, in my room, reading a book. </p> </br> -->
