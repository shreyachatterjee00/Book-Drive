<h1>About the Drive </h1>

    <h2> How was it started? </h2>
    <p> I have been tutoring at Project Read for 5 years. Over the course of helping children with math, reading, science, and all other subjects, I noticed that the children learned better through different learning styles. Because Project Read is a literacy agency, they help children who are reading below their grade level. Every day, after a child is done with their homework, they read a couple of books at their level to further their learning. I have always been an avid reader and a bookworm since I was a child, and I wanted to foster the children's love of reading by adding to their collection. So, I combined what I had noticed with passion for helping these children love reading and aimed to start a book drive to specifically collect different kinds of books for different types of learners. </p>
    <h2> What are the different types of learning? What types of books were collected? </h2>
    <p> According to some research and what I noticed from tutoring, there are children who learn visually, audially, kinesthetically, and those who learn by writing. <br/>
    <p> <strong> Visual Learners: </strong> I collected books with images inside and large print. </p></br>
    <p> <strong> Audial learners: </strong> I collected books with audio tapes and CDs. </p></br>
<p> <strong> Kinesthetic learners:</strong> I collected books with textured surfaces or pages. </p></br>
<p> <strong> Learners who prefer writing: </strong>I collected books with spaces inside for writing phrases or letters. </p>
    </p>
    <h2> Who does it benefit? </h2>
    <p> All the books were donated to Project Read, a tutoring agency. </p>
    <h2> How many books were collected? </h2>
    <p> Overall, I'm so happy that I collected 1,024 books! Check out the "Story of My Drive" page for details. </p>
